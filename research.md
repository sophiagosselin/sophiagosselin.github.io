### Research Interests

I am fascinated by all domains of life; I do not limit myself to a single study organism - though I do hold a soft spot for molusks, fish, lycophytes, mosses, algae, and any species of phytoplankton. Currently I work primarily with viral and bacterial genomes, with occasional forrays into yeast, archaeal, and algal genomes.

My research questions focus principally on the evolution, distribution, and spread of mobile genetic elements. I am first and foremost a bioinformatician, though I am more than happy to do field work or learn labratory techniques if need be. 

My thesis work on the spread of inteins in actinobacteriophages led me to my current research questions, which are as follows:
- How do inteins and orphan homing endonucleases interact? 
- How often are new intein architectures formed?
- How many of our annotations of "degrading" inteins are actually those with differing architectures?
- How widespread are crpyic homing endonucleases?

However, moving forward, I am open to investigating the evolution of other genes, genomes, and systems. There is, after all, a never ending supply of fascinating evolutionary questions within the field of genetics.
