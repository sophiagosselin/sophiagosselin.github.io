## About Me

Hi!

My name is Sophia Gosselin (she/her/hers) and I am currently a PhD student at the University of Connecticut. I work within the [Gogarten lab](https://j.p.gogarten.uconn.edu/) and have actively and previously been a collaborator on several multi-lab projects - both international and domestic. If you are interested in my previous publications, research interests, or anything else science related, then you can find out more on my [research page](/research/).

From a young age I have always been interested in biology - I have spent innumerable afternoons as a child investigating local streams and swamps - this has carried into aulthood. While I do not actively work with any organisms for my research, I do maintain a small greenhouse cabinet, several small aquariums, and reguarly pull out the microscope to investigate the former two.

Outside of biology I hold a deep pasion for story telling, history, and existential/psychologial horror. This has in turn evolved into a love of table-top RPG's, world building, and fiction writing. The latter of which may eventually be posted here, at least in part.
