#### Hello and welcome! 

My name is Sophia Gosselin, and I am a bioinformatician, evolutionary biologist, and weird snail person all rolled up into one. 

If you wish to know anything about me, see my [about me page](/about/). Otherwise all of my research interests are located [here](/research/).

Thank you for visiting!
