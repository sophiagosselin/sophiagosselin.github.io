#### Hello and welcome! 

<img style="float: right; width:200px" src="images\headshot.jpg"/>

<p style="float: left;"> My name is Sophia Gosselin, and I am a bioinformatician, evolutionary biologist, and weird snail person all rolled up into one.

If you wish to know anything about me, see my [about me page](/about.md). Otherwise all of my research interests are located [here](/research.md).

Thank you for visiting!</p>
