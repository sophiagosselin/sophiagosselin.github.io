#### Hello and welcome! 

<img style="float: right" style="width:200px;" src="images\headshot.jpg"/>

My name is Sophia Gosselin, and I am a bioinformatician, evolutionary biologist, and weird snail person all rolled up into one. 

If you wish to know anything about me, see my [about me page](/about.md). Otherwise all of my research interests are located [here](/research.md).

Thank you for visiting!
